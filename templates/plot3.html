        “Subjective Wellbeing” critical in defining a country's true “happiness” ? </h3>
        <br>
    <p>
        This project aims to analyze the global state of ‘happiness’ in the world, from 2006 to 2020, from people in over 150 countries, using the Happiness Report dataset obtained from the Kaggle website. The data contains a variable called 'Life Ladder' which indicates each country’s level of ‘happiness’ and will be the target variable for this project. The rest of the variables are the predictors which have been used to determine the level of ‘happiness’ based on population survey responses. 
        Our aim is to eliminate subjective data based on these surveys and establish a model based on measurable, economic variables to achieve unbiased results. 
Once the model is established we will be using to predict the Life Ladder for 2021.

Using this information, we will look to find out which  measurements of well-being are essential to discovering the ‘key to happiness’.

    <p>
        "The definition of the Happiness Index originates from the Bhutanese Gross National Happiness Index. In 1972, Bhutan started prioritizing happiness over other factors such as wealth, comfort and economic growth. They created an indexation for happiness based on multiple measurable factors and have kept track of this index ever since. 
        The World Happiness Index was first created by the Global Happiness Council,a group of independent academic happiness specialists. This group of people has released the World Happiness Report (WHR) every year since 2012."

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">At the other hand, there are very low correlation between perception of Curroption, social support and Freedom when compared to GDP and life expectancy, very possible due to the subjectivity of the way data are

    <h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Prediction Model</h3>
    <p>
        In order to answer the question about the importance of subjective wellbeing measurements to the 
        happiness index, we have removed all subjective variables from our prediction model, 
        such as perception of freedom, perception of corruption, generosity.
        These variables were based on survey results and the only considered variables were GDP and
        Life Expectancy for training and testing our data. </p>

    <p>Not surprisingly, our model shows that life expectancy has a higher importance (92%) 
        in relation to the second variable GDP, therefore being the main feature of the model. </p>
        
    <p>Using the trained model to make predictions on 2021 data, we got an R-Squared value of 0.64 revealing
        that 64% of the data fit the regression model. 
        The table below shows the Predication (and Actual) happiness index for 2021:</p>

            
        <p>
            Based on the results , it appaears that subjective wellbeing mesurements could be 
            a relatively significant measure of happiness.
