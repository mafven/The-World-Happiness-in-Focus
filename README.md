### Final Project - MVenables June - 2021
### Life, Wealth and Perceptions – The World’s Happiness in Focus

In the last few decades, many changes have occurred in international economics, due to the dynamic process of globalization, internationalization, emergencies related to technological paradigms, civil and global conflicts, pandemics and so on. It has become more evident than ever that there is a need for countries to outline strategic policies to establish a sustainable route for their development. In the following scenario, the pursuit of happiness becomes one of the emerging key areas of focus.

This final project will aim to analyze the global state of ‘happiness’ in the world, from 2006 to 2020, from people in over 150 countries, using the Happiness Report dataset obtained from the Kaggle website. The data contains a variable called 'Life Ladder' which indicates each country’s level of ‘happiness’ and will be the target variable for this project. The rest of the variables are the predictors which have been used to determine the level of ‘happiness’ based on population survey responses. Our aim is to eliminate subjective data based on these surveys and establish a model based on measurable, economic variables to achieve unbiased results. 
Once the model is established we will be using to predict the Life Ladder for 2021.

Using this information, we will look to find out which  measurements of well-being are essential to discovering the ‘key to happiness’.


### 1.1 Data source
The Happiness Report dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021).

In total, we have six variables, and each variable reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. These variables currently include:
      - Perceptions of corruption > It is calculated by averaging the answers to the following 2 questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”
      -	Generosity (determined by the Gallup World Poll survey results) “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?”
      -	Freedom to make life choices (determined by the Gallup World Poll survey results) “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”
      -	Social support (determined by the Gallup World Poll survey results) “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
      -	Healthy life expectancy (calculated by the WHO based on over 100 different health factors.)
      -	GDP per capita (Each country calculates GDP independently
